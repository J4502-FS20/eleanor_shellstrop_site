				<p>Whoa, did you see that? That had italics in the font!
				<p>
				<p>That was the <em>em</em> tag, which emphasizes text so that a screen reader can know that the text needs to be emphasized. It emphasizes the content.</p>
				<p>If you just need to show the text in italics but don't need to emphasize it, you can present it in italics using the <i>i</i> tag.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>There is also the <strong>strong</strong> tag, which emphasizes text so that a screen reader can know that the text needs to be emphasized. It emphasizes the content and appears in bold.</p>
				<p>If you just need to show the text in bold but don't need to emphasize it, you can present it in bold using the <b>b</b> tag.</p>
